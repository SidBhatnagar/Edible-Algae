For this assignment you will work with a .csv data-set. Your goal is to read it in, wrangle it, produce some plotting, in order to demonstrate that you are able to use the functions, plotting, and markdown format we have been learning.
You shall hand in your work as a jupyter-lab R notebook comprehending the code, the plots and, very important, enough comments and explanations for us to understand what you did, how you did it, and why you did it. Remember: no comments, no marks.
You can either modify this notebook or write a new one from scratch.
